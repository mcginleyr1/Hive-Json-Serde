= Overview =

[http://hadoop.apache.org/hive/ Hive] ([http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive wiki]) is a fantastic addition to [http://hadoop.apache.org/ Hadoop]. From Hive's website:

  Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop that provides tools to
  enable easy data summarization, adhoc querying and analysis of large datasets data stored
  in Hadoop files. It provides a mechanism to put structure on this data and it also
  provides a simple query language called Hive QL which is based on SQL and which enables
  users familiar with SQL to query this data. At the same time, this language also allows 
  traditional map/reduce programmers to be able to plug in their custom mappers and
  reducers to do more sophisticated analysis which may not be supported by the built-in
  capabilities of the language. 

Unfortunately, as at the time of writing, Hive is unable to read and write data in [http://www.json.org/ JSON] format.

To remedy this, I have created a JSON !SerDe available here as source or as a JAR file you can add (See [GettingStarted]).

The JSON library I used is the standard Java one found at [http://www.json.org/java/index.html json.org]. 

= Limitations =

At the present time, the !SerDe has the following limitations:
 * Cannot be used to write JSON files (need to implement Serialization: Issue #1)
 * Limited support for complex tables/JSON files (Issue #2)
